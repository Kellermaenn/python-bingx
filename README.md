# BingX-Client

BingX-Client is a Python library that simplifies the process of interfacing with the BingX API. It provides an easy-to-use interface that allows developers to interact with the BingX service using Python, and includes functions and classes that abstract the complexity of the API.

# Installation

You can install BingX-Client using pip:

```python
pip install bingx-client
```

# Usage

To use BingX-Client, you first need to import the package and create an instance of the client. You can then use the client to interact with the BingX API.
The BingX-Client library includes three interfaces for each version of the API: trade, market, and account. You can access these interfaces using the client object.

# API Version Support

The BingX API has two versions: v1 and v2. BingX-Client supports both versions of the API, and includes separate interfaces for each version. To specify which version of the API you want to use, you can pass the version parameter when creating the client.
