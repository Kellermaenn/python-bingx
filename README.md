# BingX-Client
BingX-Client is a Python library that simplifies the process of interfacing with the BingX API. It provides an easy-to-use interface that allows developers to interact with the BingX service using Python, and includes functions and classes that abstract the complexity of the API.

# Installation
You can install BingX-Client using pip:

# Copy code
```python
pip install bingx-client
```

# Usage
To use BingX-Client, you first need to import the package and create an instance of the client. You can then use the client to interact with the BingX API.

The BingX-Client library includes three interfaces for each version of the API: trade, market, and account. You can access these interfaces using the client object.

# API Version Support
The BingX API has two versions: v1 and v2. BingX-Client supports both versions of the API, and includes separate interfaces for each version. To specify which version of the API you want to use, you can pass the version parameter when creating the client.

#Examples
python
Copy code
from bingx_client import BingXClient

client = BingXClient(api_key='your-api-key')

# Get the current BTC-USD market price
price = client.get_market_price('BTC-USD')

print(f"Current BTC-USD price: {price}")

# Get the last 10 trades for BTC-USD
trades = client.trade.get_trades('BTC-USD', limit=10)

# Get the order book for ETH-BTC
order_book = client.market.get_order_book('ETH-BTC')

# Get the account balance for your BingX account
balance = client.account.get_balance()
